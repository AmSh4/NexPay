# NexPay: Next-Generation Payment Ecosystem

- **NexPay** is an `open-source framework` for simulating and prototyping a scalable payment processing system. Inspired by **real-world payment gateways**, it focuses on frictionless user experiences, robust backend logic, intelligent data-driven operations, and reliable infrastructure. 
- Built to tackle fintech challenges at scale, NexPay handles _simulated transactions_, _merchant management, and automated operations using functional programming, AI, and distributed systems_.

## Features

- **Frictionless Payments**: 1-click payment flows with native-like payment pages using React.
- **Backend Logic**: Functional programming (Ramda) for UPI-like integrations, authentication, and complex payment rules.
- **Data Intelligence**: Machine learning for anomaly detection, intelligent traffic routing, and transaction visualizations.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based multi-container setup simulating multi-DC architecture and edge computing.
- **Merchant Management**: Low-code tools for merchants to configure payment options.
- **Self-Service**: Configurable modules for end-users to customize payment workflows.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for high-volume simulated transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Ramda (FP), Mongoose, GraphQL
- **Data Science**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, MongoDB
- **Testing**: Jest for backend unit tests

### Running the Project

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run start

3. Train ML models:
   ```bash
   cd datascience
   python scripts/train_anomaly_model.py

## Usage Examples

- Process a Payment: Use the OneClickPayment component to simulate a UPI payment.
- Merchant Config: Access the merchant dashboard to manage payment options.
- Anomaly Detection: Run detect_anomalies.py to identify unusual transactions.
- Visualization: Generate charts with visualize_data.py.
- Deployment: Use deploy.sh to simulate multi-DC deployment.
