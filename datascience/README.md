# NexPay: Next-Generation Payment Ecosystem

NexPay is an open-source framework for simulating and prototyping a scalable payment processing system. Inspired by real-world payment gateways, it focuses on frictionless user experiences, robust backend logic, intelligent data-driven operations, and reliable infrastructure. Built to tackle fintech challenges at scale, NexPay handles simulated transactions, merchant management, and automated operations using functional programming, AI, and distributed systems.

## Features

- **Frictionless Payments**: 1-click payment flows with native-like payment pages using React.
- **Backend Logic**: Functional programming (Ramda) for UPI-like integrations, authentication, and complex payment rules.
- **Data Intelligence**: Machine learning for anomaly detection, intelligent traffic routing, and transaction visualizations.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based multi-container setup simulating multi-DC architecture and edge computing.
- **Merchant Management**: Low-code tools for merchants to configure payment options.
- **Self-Service**: Configurable modules for end-users to customize payment workflows.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for high-volume simulated transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Ramda (FP), Mongoose, GraphQL
- **Data Science**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, MongoDB
- **Testing**: Jest for backend unit tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- Python >= 3.10
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (local or cloud)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexpay.git
   cd nexpay

Install frontend dependencies:
bashcd frontend
npm install

Install backend dependencies:
bashcd ../backend
npm install

Install data science dependencies:
bashcd ../datascience
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:

Copy .env.sample to .env in frontend, backend, and infrastructure folders.
Update MONGO_URI and other variables as needed.


Start MongoDB (via Docker or locally).

Running the Project

Start the backend:
bashcd backend
npm run start

Start the frontend:
bashcd frontend
npm run start

Train ML models:
bashcd datascience
python scripts/train_anomaly_model.py

Deploy infrastructure:
bashcd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d


Access the app at http://localhost:3000.

Usage Examples

Process a Payment: Use the OneClickPayment component to simulate a UPI payment.
Merchant Config: Access the merchant dashboard to manage payment options.
Anomaly Detection: Run detect_anomalies.py to identify unusual transactions.
Visualization: Generate charts with visualize_data.py.
Deployment: Use deploy.sh to simulate multi-DC deployment.
